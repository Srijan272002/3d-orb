- [x] Set up development server (Vite/Webpack/Parcel)

### 1.2 Dependencies Installation
```bash
npm init -y
npm install three
npm install --save-dev vite  # For development server
```

### 1.3 Basic File Structure
```
project-root/
├── index.html
├── src/
│   ├── main.js
│   ├── styles.css
│   └── assets/
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

## Phase 2: Three.js Foundation

### 2.1 Core Three.js Setup
- [x] Create HTML canvas element
- [x] Initialize Three.js scene
- [x] Set up WebGL renderer
- [x] Configure camera (PerspectiveCamera)
- [x] Implement basic render loop

### 2.2 Essential Components
- [x] **Scene**: Container for all 3D objects
- [x] **Camera**: Define viewing perspective
- [x] **Renderer**: WebGL renderer for displaying 3D graphics
- [x] **Animation Loop**: requestAnimationFrame for smooth rendering

## Phase 3: Sphere Creation

### 3.1 Geometry Creation
- [x] Use `SphereGeometry` class
- [x] Configure sphere parameters:
  - Radius
  - Width segments (detail level)
  - Height segments (detail level)
- [x] Optimize segment count for performance vs quality

### 3.2 Material Options (Choose One or More)
- [x] **Basic Material**: `MeshBasicMaterial` (no lighting)
- [x] **Lambert Material**: `MeshLambertMaterial` (diffuse lighting)
- [x] **Phong Material**: `MeshPhongMaterial` (specular highlights)
- [x] **Standard Material**: `MeshStandardMaterial` (PBR - physically based rendering)
- [ ] **Custom Shader Material**: Advanced custom effects

### 3.3 Mesh Creation
- [x] Combine geometry and material into Mesh
- [x] Add mesh to scene
- [x] Position sphere in 3D space

## Phase 4: Lighting & Shading

### 4.1 Basic Lighting Setup
- [x] **Ambient Light**: Overall scene illumination
- [x] **Directional Light**: Sun-like lighting
- [x] **Point Light**: Bulb-like lighting (optional)
- [x] **Spot Light**: Flashlight-like lighting (optional)

### 4.2 Advanced Lighting
- [x] Configure light intensity and colors
- [x] Position lights for optimal sphere illumination
- [x] Add shadows (if desired)
- [x] Light helpers for debugging

## Phase 5: Camera Controls & Interaction

### 5.1 Camera Controls
- [x] Install `OrbitControls` from Three.js examples
- [x] Enable mouse/touch interaction:
  - Rotation around sphere
  - Zoom in/out
  - Pan controls
- [x] Set control limits and constraints

### 5.2 Responsive Design
- [x] Handle window resize events
- [x] Update camera aspect ratio
- [x] Resize renderer canvas
- [x] Maintain performance across devices

## Phase 6: Animation & Effects

### 6.1 Basic Animations
- [x] Sphere rotation on axis
- [x] Floating/bobbing motion
- [x] Pulsing scale effect
- [x] Color transitions

### 6.2 Advanced Visual Effects
- [x] **Wireframe mode**: Toggle wireframe view
- [ ] **Texture mapping**: Apply surface textures
- [ ] **Normal maps**: Add surface detail
- [ ] **Environment mapping**: Reflective surfaces
- [x] **Particle effects**: Surrounding particle system

## Phase 7: Performance Optimization

### 7.1 Rendering Optimization
- [ ] Implement frustum culling
- [ ] Level of detail (LOD) for different distances
- [ ] Efficient animation loops
- [ ] Memory management

### 7.2 Code Optimization
- [ ] Minimize geometry recreations
- [ ] Reuse materials where possible
- [ ] Implement object pooling (if needed)
- [ ] Profile and optimize bottlenecks

## Phase 8: Advanced Features (Optional)

### 8.1 Interactive Features
- [ ] Mouse hover effects
- [ ] Click interactions
- [x] Keyboard controls
- [x] Touch gestures for mobile

### 8.2 Visual Enhancements
- [ ] Post-processing effects (bloom, etc.)
- [ ] Multiple sphere variations
- [ ] Dynamic environment
- [ ] Sound integration

### 8.3 UI Integration
- [ ] Control panel for tweaking parameters
- [ ] Material property adjustments
- [ ] Animation speed controls
- [ ] Export/screenshot functionality

## Phase 9: Testing & Deployment

### 9.1 Testing
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility
- [ ] Mobile device testing
- [ ] Performance testing on various hardware
- [ ] Error handling and fallbacks

### 9.2 Deployment
- [ ] Build optimization
- [ ] Asset compression
- [ ] CDN setup (if needed)
- [ ] Deploy to hosting platform

## Key Technical Considerations

### Performance Tips
- Keep polygon count reasonable (32-64 segments usually sufficient)
- Use efficient materials (avoid complex shaders if not needed)
- Implement proper disposal of resources
- Monitor frame rate and memory usage

### Best Practices
- Modular code structure
- Comment complex calculations
- Use meaningful variable names
- Implement error handling
- Keep render loop efficient

### Browser Compatibility
- WebGL support required
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile browser considerations
- Fallback options for older browsers

## Expected Timeline
- **Phase 1-2**: 1-2 days (Setup and basics)
- **Phase 3-4**: 1-2 days (Sphere creation and lighting)
- **Phase 5**: 1 day (Controls and interaction)
- **Phase 6**: 2-3 days (Animation and effects)
- **Phase 7-9**: 1-2 days (Optimization and deployment)

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-10 days (depending on complexity and features)
